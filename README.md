CSE572 Database Systems
With Dr. Vu

## Labs
* Majority of the labs consist of SQL queries performed on a database.
In lab 7, we were to create a simple database by creating tables with
their constraints, inserting data into the tables, and creating queries
to test the database. 

## Homework
* Homework included various problems related to database design. Most
of the problems included creating ER/EER diagrams, normalizing tables,
and implementing databases.

## Project
* This was a term project to implement a complete database. We were given
the details and requirements for the given company. We created the 
required documentation including EER diagram, Relational Schema, data
dictonary, and required views and queries. Next we implemented the 
database by creating tables and their constraints, inserted test data
into the tables, and produced queries that tested the functionnilty of 
the database.
